Rush Hour - AI Final Project
----------------------------
  
Running the program
-------------------

We implemented this project using Python language. "Games.py" is the main file, hence, to run our project,
the following command needs to be executed (via the shell): "python Games.py".
•	First, the difficulty of the game needs to be selected, by pressing 1 for easy, 2 for medium, 3 for hard.
•	Then, the search algorithm needs to be selected, by pressing 1 for A* and 2 for IDA*
•	Last, the heuristic needs to be selected, there are 9 difference heuristics as mentioned above, and 
	they are listed on screen for the user to choose from.
Thus, after the three parameters were selected, our AI solver prints the boards and the steps it chose on
its way to the goal state (the solution).
